# Palindrome and Complement Validation of the Reversed DNA String (SASM)


Note: Run this through command prompt. 

1. You can only enter a string ranging from 1-20 characters that has either of the following: A, C, G, and T. 
2. The string will be checked if its reverse state is a complement and a palindrome of the given string. 
3. There will prompts of error if the first instruction is not followed.
